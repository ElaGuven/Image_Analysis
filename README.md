# Image Analysis and Processing Using Python

This repository contains the code and report for image analysis and processing tasks using Python. These projects were completed as part of the **Research Skills: Image Analysis** course at Tilburg University.

## Project Overview

The assignments in this repository focus on various image processing techniques, including:

1. **Image Smoothing and Frequency Domain Analysis**:
   - Conversion of color images to grayscale.
   - Addition of salt-and-pepper noise and denoising using Gaussian blur in both spatial and frequency domains.
   - Comparison of performance and execution time between spatial and frequency domain operations.

2. **Vessel Segmentation and Analysis**:
   - Segmentation of blood vessels from retinal images using different algorithms.
   - Evaluation of segmentation accuracy using Dice and Jaccard scores.
   - Analysis of the vascular network, including vessel length, width, and orientation.

## Files in the Repository

- **`AssignmentP1_Ela_Guven.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook for Part 1 of the assignment, focusing on image smoothing and frequency domain analysis.
- **`AssignmentP2P3_Ela_Guven.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook for Part 2 and Part 3 of the assignment, dealing with vessel segmentation and morphological analysis.
